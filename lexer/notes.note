## How to write a lexer in C?

1. Define token types (enum for keywords, numbers, symbols, indentifiers, etc)

2. Scan through your source string, one character at a time

3. Group sequences of characters into tokens
 - If you see a letter, read as long as it's a letter/number to get a keyword or identifier
 - If you see a digit, read all digits for a number.
 - If you see +, -, *, etc., treat as a symbol token.
 - If you see whitespace, skip it.

4. Return a list (array) of tokens
